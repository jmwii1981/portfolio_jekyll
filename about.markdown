        <h2 class="h2">My Path</h2>
        <p class="p">My fascination with technology has always been fueled by a relentless curiosity to understand how things work and explore ways to improve them. Driven by a commitment to continuous learning, I’ve immersed myself in coding, programming design, art principles, and human-centered design—blending these disciplines to navigate the nuances of product development. Each challenge has deepened my commitment to crafting thoughtful, accessible solutions that elevate every experience in meaningful ways. Today, I inspire a team fueled by curiosity and purpose, united in building standout products that make a real impact—creating seamless, lasting, and meaningful interactions for everyone who engages with our designs.</p>
