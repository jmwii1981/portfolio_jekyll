                    <p class="p">Jan might be the most organized person I have met. Jan was my Hiring Manager during my Product Design Internship at Heartland. I consider myself very lucky to have had Jan as a leader. He encouraged me to solve problems on my own while providing the support I needed. Jan guided me on how to be a detective in order to understand complex problems. Because of his guidance, I now have a much better way to gather and organize information. He is great at planning and equally great at adapting the plan as things change. He is a brilliant team member who I always felt comfortable going to for help.</p>
                    <p class="p">Jan has a bright enthusiasm for people, software, and accessibility. I think he would be willing to tackle nearly any problem.</p>
                    <p class="p">It is a relief when Jan is in charge. I highly recommend him as a leader and a general practitioner.</p>
